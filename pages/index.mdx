`vc build` takes your project directory as input and produces [build output](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/v3) that can then be deployed directly to [vercel.com].
It sounds straightforward but there's a lot that happens along the way! The best place to start is [build.ts](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/main/packages/cli/src/commands/build.ts).
