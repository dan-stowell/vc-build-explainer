# About

Looking at a program's build system loads the program into my head in a way that sticks.
I don't really understand a system until I have a physical model of it in my head:
first this happens, then that happens. You take these inputs and produce these outputs.

So, to load Vercel into my head, I'm starting by breaking down the [`vc build`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/build) command.
It runs on every deploy to Vercel! Maybe I'll go deep, maybe I'll branch out, maybe I'll abandon
this attempt. Seems worthwhile, though.
